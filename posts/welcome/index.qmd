This is my Data Visualization Blog. Here, I will explore a few different data sets and attempt to tell a story for each of them. My goal is to follow the processes involved with "data storytelling": 

 - understand and explain the context of the data
 - choose effective visuals
 - eliminate clutter
 - focus attention on a particular trend(s) in the data
 - tell a story!
