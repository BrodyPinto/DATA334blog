Data Visualization Blog

Hi, my name is Brody Pinto, and I'm a student at St. Lawrence University majoring in Data Science and Biology. This is my Data Visualization (DATA334) Blog where I will explore several different data sets and try to tell a visual data story with each. The goal of these blog posts is to create background for the data, minimize clutter to focus the reader's attention on just a few important aspects of the data, and tell a story in a way that is engaging, intuitive, and insightful. The data sets I am working with include United States tornado instances, big tech stock prices, and bee colonies across the United States.
